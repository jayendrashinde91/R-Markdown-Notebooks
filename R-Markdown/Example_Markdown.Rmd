## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r sine_cos}
t <- seq(0,0.98,0.01)
y1 <- sin(2*pi*4*t)
y2 <- cos(2*pi*4*t)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r sine_cos_p, echo=FALSE}
plot(t,y1,type = "l",col="blue",ylab = "value",xlab = "time")
par(new=TRUE)
plot(t,y2,type = "l",col="red",ylab = "",xlab = "")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
